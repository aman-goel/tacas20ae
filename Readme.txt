Artifact for the paper submission - AVR: Abstractly Verifying Reachability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resource requirements:
- 4 to 8 cores (for good parallel performance)
- 4GB ram should be more than enough
- less than 15 minutes for complete evaluation

Run the script "run.sh" in the avr folder i.e.
cd avr
./run.sh

The script will first install a few dependencies and then go through running each experiment interactively.
All results and detailed logs are produced in avr/output/* folder.


AVR is available on github - https://github.com/aman-goel/avr
The artifact is maintained on github - https://github.com/aman-goel/tacas20ae
